# 🌱 SproutFlux — Version 0

SproutFlux is an iOS mobile application designed to help **The Six Farms** efficiently record, classify, and analyze farm waste. The long-term goal is to replace paper-based waste tracking with an intelligent system that integrates **Azure backend services**, **AI-powered image classification**, and **real-time insights** for farm managers.

Version **0** serves as the foundational skeleton of the app — establishing the core navigation structure and visual layout that will evolve into a fully functional system.

---

## 🚀 App Overview

SproutFlux is being built to:

- Capture waste entries quickly and intuitively  
- Classify waste using **Azure AI Vision**  
- Store data in **Azure Cosmos DB + Blob Storage**  
- Provide weekly insights and dashboards  
- Support staff vs. manager roles  
- Send notifications when waste exceeds thresholds  

Version 0 lays the groundwork for all of this.
